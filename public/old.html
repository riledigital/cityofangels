                Hollywood made the city world-famous. In the early 1900s,
                filmmakers began moving to the Los Angeles area to escape the
                rigorous rules imposed by Thomas Edison’s Motion Picture Patents
                Company in New Jersey. The famous Hollywood sign was erected in
                1923 as “Hollywoodland” to advertise for a new housing
                development, and the “Hollywood Walk of Fame” was built soon after
                in 1956. It currently has well over 2,000 names added to the
                star-studded sidewalk for contributing to the entertainment
                industry (SMExpress, 2019).

                Originally called "Venice of America," Venice was founded in 1905
                by tobacco millionaire Abbot Kinney as a 14-mile beach resort town
                (LAist, 2018). Inspired by the enchantment of Venice, Italy,
                Kinney unveiled the resort town and amusement park to 40,000
                visitors. The park featured Italian gondoliers poling their boats
                down fairy-lit canals, a concert orchestra supplying music that
                could be heard nearly all over town, camel rides, exotic hotels
                catering to the best tastes, and a miniature railroad circling the
                entire scene (LA Times, 1998). This vibrant atmosphere continues
                today (Venice, 2019).

              We began with the LA Times neighborhood boundaries. We then selected
              311 calls for "homelessness encampment" complaints for the City of
              Los Angeles in 2018. We also used Airbnb listing locations available
              on the countermapping website, Inside Airbnb, for the month of
              September 2019. The two data sets were analyzed in Python to
              calculate the density of values per acre and three neighborhoods
              were selected based on highest density of homeless encampment
              complaints and Airbnb listings. To understand the complexity of the
              dichotomy, a narrative for each neighborhood is shared, along with
              contrasting visuals and descriptions about Airbnb and homelessness.
