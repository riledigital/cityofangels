        HOMELESSNESS IN THE CITY OF ANGELS

        A data story by Regina Joy Alcazar and Ri Le
      </p>

      <p class="lead">
        Welcome to Los Angeles!
      </p>

      <h3>
        The pervasive issue of poverty and homelessness in Los Angeles
      </h3>

      <p>
        Homelessness is a chronic problem plaguing the region perched
        below palm-tree-lined, iridescent sunsets, bustling show biz
        glamour and a cultural richness reflected in its culinary
        offerings, thriving creative community and sprawling estates.
        Compared to previous years, 2019 saw a stark increase in the
        number of people living in tents, vehicles, and shelters in both
        the City and County of Los Angeles–12% and 16% respectively
        (LAHSA, 2019).
      </p>
      <h3>
        Encampments through 311 complaints
      </h3>
      <p>
        The city's sunny skies and spacious built environment draw over
        50 million visitors a year. Considering these preferential
        living conditions, the city provides an ideal landscape for the
        houseless to build their own homes. Whereever space permits,
        homeless encampments rise in clusters or in isolation,
        deconstructing the very notion of place and home.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Fantasy vs reality: a home for who?
      </h3>
      <p>
        This data journalism project investigates the extent of
        homelessness at three of Los Angeles' most iconic neighborhoods.
        We present a dichotomy between a fantasmic, imagined Los Angeles
        with the reality of homelessness in order to show the pervasive
        extent of housing insecurity across the beautiful City of Angels
        that is often romanticized in pop culture. To do this, we
        contrast georeferenced Airbnb rentals with 311 calls of homeless
        encampments in 2018 to produce this interactive web story.
      </p>

      <p>
        This perception of a La-La-Land that is often projected onto Los
        Angeles is illustrated with a juxtaposition of two transient
        communities: Airbnb renters and the homeless.

        <q>Koreatown is a bit of a misnomer. In truth, if we're sticking

        K-Town has the highest density of Homelessness in the City of Los
        Angeles. The passage of the Hart-Celler Act of 1965 resulted in a
        demographic shift across the country, encouraging an influx of
        immigrants that changed the cultural landscape of Los Angeles and
        catalyzed the growth of "The best Koreatown outside of Korea"
        (Curbed LA, 2019). Encompassing approximately 3 square miles just
        west of Downtown LA and south of Hollywood, the area was once the
        epicenter of Golden Age Hollywood, home to the Ambassador Hotel,
        the Cocoanut Grove and the Brown Derb. Today, Korean and Latinx
        populations contribute to Koreatown’s rich cultural diversity
        (Discover LA, 2019).

        Rental types

      <figure class="vizContainerFigure">
        <p class="viz-description">
          A transient traveler has many considerations for selecting a
          rental: the amenities offered, the general aesthetic of the
          living environment, and space needed. This affects the choice
          among the four rental type options. For those without any other
          choice in the City of Los Angeles, more affordable options like
          tents, vehicles, and shelters housed 36,165 people in 2019
          (LAHSA).

        Minimum Nights
      </h3>
      <figure class="vizContainerFigure">
        <p class="viz-description">
          Ranging from one day to a few months, Airbnb hosts can require a
          minimum number of nights a renter could stay in their rental.
          This offers a preview into the length of time a transient
          traveler might stay in the neighborhood and why they might be
          visiting, whether for long-term work or a short-term vacation.
          By contrast, 23% of the homeless population surveyed experienced
          homelessness for the first-time that year, whereas chronic
          homelessness increased by 17% (LAHSA, 2019).

        <p class="viz-description">
          How much money would a transient traveler pay to visit? In
          contrast, economic factors are the main driver of increases in
          homelessness and Los Angeles is the least affordable housing
          market in the United States (LAHSA, 2019).
