        Welcome to Los Angeles!
      </p>

      <h3>
        The pervasive issue of poverty and homelessness in Los Angeles
      </h3>

      <p>
        Homelessness is a chronic problem plaguing the region perched
        below palm-tree-lined, iridescent sunsets, bustling show biz
        glamour and a cultural richness reflected in its culinary
        offerings, thriving creative community and sprawling estates.
        Compared to previous years, 2019 saw a stark increase in the
        number of people living in tents, vehicles, and shelters in both
        the City and County of Los Angelesâ€“12% and 16% respectively
        (LAHSA, 2019).
      </p>
      <h3>
        Encampments through 311 complaints
      </h3>
      <p>
        The city's sunny skies and spacious built environment draw over
        50 million visitors a year. Considering these preferential
        living conditions, the city provides an ideal landscape for the
        houseless to build their own homes. Whereever space permits,
        homeless encampments rise in clusters or in isolation,
        deconstructing the very notion of place and home.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Fantasy vs reality: a home for who?
      </h3>
      <p>
        This data journalism project investigates the extent of
        homelessness at three of Los Angeles' most iconic neighborhoods.
        We present a dichotomy between a fantasmic, imagined Los Angeles
        with the reality of homelessness in order to show the pervasive
        extent of housing insecurity across the beautiful City of Angels
        that is often romanticized in pop culture. To do this, we
        contrast georeferenced Airbnb rentals with 311 calls of homeless
        encampments in 2018 to produce this interactive web story.
      </p>

      <p>
        This perception of a La-La-Land that is often projected onto Los
        Angeles is illustrated with a juxtaposition of two transient
        communities: Airbnb renters and the homeless.
