        <h3>The pervasive issue of poverty and homelessness in Los Angeles</h3>

        <p>
          Homelessness is a chronic problem plaguing the region perched below
          palm-tree-lined, iridescent sunsets, bustling show biz glamour and a
          cultural richness reflected in its culinary offerings, thriving
          creative community and sprawling estates. Compared to previous years,
          2019 saw a stark increase in the number of people living in tents,
          vehicles, and shelters in both the City and County of Los Angeles–12%
          and 16% respectively (LAHSA, 2019).
        </p>
        <h3>Encampments through 311 complaints</h3>
        <p>
          The city's sunny skies and spacious built environment draw over 50
          million visitors a year. Considering these preferential living
          conditions, the city provides an ideal landscape for the houseless to
          build their own homes. Whereever space permits, homeless encampments
          rise in clusters or in isolation, deconstructing the very notion of
          place and home.
        </p>

        <h3>Fantasy vs reality: a home for who?</h3>
        <p>
          This data journalism project investigates the extent of homelessness
          at three of Los Angeles' most iconic neighborhoods. We present a
          dichotomy between a fantasmic, imagined Los Angeles with the reality
          of homelessness in order to show the pervasive extent of housing
          insecurity across the beautiful City of Angels that is often
          romanticized in pop culture. To do this, we contrast georeferenced
          Airbnb rentals with 311 calls of homeless encampments in 2018 to
          produce this interactive web story.
        </p>

        <p>
          This perception of a La-La-Land that is often projected onto Los
          Angeles is illustrated with a juxtaposition of two transient
          communities: Airbnb renters and the homeless.

        K-Town has the highest density of Homelessness in the City of Los
        Angeles. The passage of the Hart-Celler Act of 1965 resulted in a
        demographic shift across the country, encouraging an influx of
        immigrants that changed the cultural landscape of Los Angeles and
        catalyzed the growth of "The best Koreatown outside of Korea" (Curbed
        LA, 2019). Encompassing approximately 3 square miles just west of
        Downtown LA and south of Hollywood, the area was once the epicenter of
        Golden Age Hollywood, home to the Ambassador Hotel, the Cocoanut Grove
        and the Brown Derb. Today, Korean and Latinx populations contribute to
        Koreatown’s rich cultural diversity (Discover LA, 2019).

      <p slot="intro-p">
        Hollywood made the city world-famous. In the early 1900s, filmmakers
        began moving to the Los Angeles area to escape the rigorous rules
        imposed by Thomas Edison’s Motion Picture Patents Company in New Jersey.
        The famous Hollywood sign was erected in 1923 as “Hollywoodland” to
        advertise for a new housing development, and the “Hollywood Walk of
        Fame” was built soon after in 1956. It currently has well over 2,000
        names added to the star-studded sidewalk for contributing to the
        entertainment industry (SMExpress, 2019).

        The main strip of Hollywood Boulevard sees a large concentration of

        homeless encampment reports. Since the Walk of Fame is a
        highly-trafficked tourist destination, could this void in homelessness
        encampments be explained by sweeps and clearings?

        Originally called "Venice of America," Venice was founded in 1905 by
        tobacco millionaire Abbot Kinney as a 14-mile beach resort town (LAist,
        2018). Inspired by the enchantment of Venice, Italy, Kinney unveiled the
        resort town and amusement park to 40,000 visitors. The park featured
        Italian gondoliers poling their boats down fairy-lit canals, a concert
        orchestra supplying music that could be heard nearly all over town,
        camel rides, exotic hotels catering to the best tastes, and a miniature
        railroad circling the entire scene (LA Times, 1998). This vibrant
        atmosphere continues today (Venice, 2019).

        <h2>Methodology and data sources</h2>
        <p>
          We began with the LA Times neighborhood boundaries. We then selected
          311 calls for "homelessness encampment" complaints for the City of Los
          Angeles in 2018. We also used Airbnb listing locations available on
          the countermapping website, Inside Airbnb, for the month of September
          2019. The two data sets were analyzed in Python to calculate the
          density of values per acre and three neighborhoods were selected based
          on highest density of homeless encampment complaints and Airbnb
          listings. To understand the complexity of the dichotomy, a narrative
          for each neighborhood is shared, along with contrasting visuals and
          descriptions about Airbnb and homelessness.
