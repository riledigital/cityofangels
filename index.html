                Welcome to Los Angeles!
              </p>
              <p>
                Homelessness is a chronic problem plaguing the region perched
                below palm-tree-lined, iridescent sunsets, bustling show biz
                glamour and a cultural richness reflected in its culinary
                offerings, thriving creative community and sprawling estates.
                Compared to previous years, 2019 saw a stark increase in the
                number of people living in tents, vehicles, and shelters in both
                the City and County of Los Angeles–12% and 16% respectively
                (LAHSA, 2019).
              </p>

              <p>
                The city's sunny skies and spacious built environment draw over
                50 million visitors a year. Considering these preferential
                living conditions, the city provides an ideal landscape for the
                houseless to build their own homes. Whereever space permits,
                homeless encampments rise in clusters or in isolation,
                deconstructing the very notion of place and home.
              </p>

              <p>
                This data journalism project investigates the extent of
                homelessness at three of Los Angeles' most iconic neighborhoods.
                We present a dichotomy between a fantasmic, imagined Los Angeles
                with the reality of homelessness in order to show the pervasive
                extent of housing insecurity across the beautiful City of Angels
                that is often romanticized in pop culture. To do this, we
                contrast georeferenced Airbnb rentals with 311 calls of homeless
                encampments in 2018 to produce this interactive web story.

                In each neighborhood of the City of Los Angeles, we plotted the

  K-Town has the highest density of Homelessness in the City of Los
              Angeles. The passage of the Hart-Celler Act of 1965 resulted in a
              demographic shift across the country, encouraging an influx of
              immigrants that changed the cultural landscape of Los Angeles and
              catalyzed the growth of "The best Koreatown outside of Korea"
              (Curbed LA, 2019). Encompassing approximately 3 square miles just
              west of Downtown LA and south of Hollywood, the area was once the
              epicenter of Golden Age Hollywood, home to the Ambassador Hotel,
              the Cocoanut Grove and the Brown Derb. Today, Korean and Latinx
              populations contribute to Koreatown’s rich cultural diversity
              (Discover LA, 2019).

Hollywood made the city world-famous. In the early 1900s, filmmakers began moving to the Los Angeles area to escape the rigorous rules imposed by Thomas Edison’s Motion Picture Patents Company in New Jersey. The famous Hollywood sign was erected in 1923 as “Hollywoodland” to advertise for a new housing development, and the “Hollywood Walk of Fame” was built soon after in 1956. It currently has well over 2,000 names added to the star-studded sidewalk for contributing to the entertainment industry (SMExpress, 2019).

Originally called "Venice of America," Venice was founded in 1905 by tobacco millionaire Abbot Kinney as a 14-mile beach resort town (LAist, 2018). Inspired by the enchantment of Venice, Italy, Kinney unveiled the resort town and amusement park to 40,000 visitors. The park featured Italian gondoliers poling their boats down fairy-lit canals, a concert orchestra supplying music that could be heard nearly all over town, camel rides, exotic hotels catering to the best tastes, and a miniature railroad circling the entire scene (LA Times, 1998). This vibrant atmosphere continues today (Venice, 2019).            </p>
