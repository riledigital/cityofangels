                Welcome to Los Angeles!
              </p>

              <h3>
                The pervasive issue of poverty and homelessness in Los Angeles
              </h3>

              <p>
                Homelessness is a chronic problem plaguing the region perched
                below palm-tree-lined, iridescent sunsets, bustling show biz
                glamour and a cultural richness reflected in its culinary
                offerings, thriving creative community and sprawling estates.
                Compared to previous years, 2019 saw a stark increase in the
                number of people living in tents, vehicles, and shelters in both
                the City and County of Los Angeles–12% and 16% respectively
                (LAHSA, 2019).
              </p>
              <h3>
                Encampments through 311 complaints
              </h3>
              <p>
                The city's sunny skies and spacious built environment draw over
                50 million visitors a year. Considering these preferential
                living conditions, the city provides an ideal landscape for the
                houseless to build their own homes. Whereever space permits,
                homeless encampments rise in clusters or in isolation,
                deconstructing the very notion of place and home.
              </p>

              <h3>
                Fantasy vs reality: a home for who?
              </h3>
              <p>
                This data journalism project investigates the extent of
                homelessness at three of Los Angeles' most iconic neighborhoods.
                We present a dichotomy between a fantasmic, imagined Los Angeles
                with the reality of homelessness in order to show the pervasive
                extent of housing insecurity across the beautiful City of Angels
                that is often romanticized in pop culture. To do this, we
                contrast georeferenced Airbnb rentals with 311 calls of homeless
                encampments in 2018 to produce this interactive web story.
              </p>

              <p>
                This perception of a La-La-Land that is often projected onto Los
                Angeles is illustrated with a juxtaposition of two transient
                communities: Airbnb renters and the homeless.

              K-Town has the highest density of Homelessness in the City of Los
              Angeles. The passage of the Hart-Celler Act of 1965 resulted in a
              demographic shift across the country, encouraging an influx of
              immigrants that changed the cultural landscape of Los Angeles and
              catalyzed the growth of "The best Koreatown outside of Korea"
              (Curbed LA, 2019). Encompassing approximately 3 square miles just
              west of Downtown LA and south of Hollywood, the area was once the
              epicenter of Golden Age Hollywood, home to the Ambassador Hotel,
              the Cocoanut Grove and the Brown Derb. Today, Korean and Latinx
              populations contribute to Koreatown’s rich cultural diversity
              (Discover LA, 2019).

              Hollywood made the city world-famous. In the early 1900s,
              filmmakers began moving to the Los Angeles area to escape the
              rigorous rules imposed by Thomas Edison’s Motion Picture Patents
              Company in New Jersey. The famous Hollywood sign was erected in
              1923 as “Hollywoodland” to advertise for a new housing
              development, and the “Hollywood Walk of Fame” was built soon after
              in 1956. It currently has well over 2,000 names added to the
              star-studded sidewalk for contributing to the entertainment
              industry (SMExpress, 2019).

              Originally called "Venice of America," Venice was founded in 1905
              by tobacco millionaire Abbot Kinney as a 14-mile beach resort town
              (LAist, 2018). Inspired by the enchantment of Venice, Italy,
              Kinney unveiled the resort town and amusement park to 40,000
              visitors. The park featured Italian gondoliers poling their boats
              down fairy-lit canals, a concert orchestra supplying music that
              could be heard nearly all over town, camel rides, exotic hotels
              catering to the best tastes, and a miniature railroad circling the
              entire scene (LA Times, 1998). This vibrant atmosphere continues
              today (Venice, 2019).

                A transient traveler has many considerations for selecting a
                rental: the amenities offered, the general aesthetic of the
                living environment, and space needed. This affects the choice
                among the four rental type options. For those without any other
                choice in the City of Los Angeles, more affordable options like
                tents, vehicles, and shelters housed 36,165 people in 2019
                (LAHSA).

                Ranging from one day to a few months, Airbnb hosts can require a
                minimum number of nights a renter could stay in their rental.
                This offers a preview into the length of time a transient
                traveler might stay in the neighborhood and why they might be
                visiting, whether for long-term work or a short-term vacation.
                By contrast, 23% of the homeless population surveyed experienced
                homelessness for the first-time that year, whereas chronic
                homelessness increased by 17% (LAHSA, 2019).

                How much money would a transient traveler pay to visit? In
                contrast, economic factors are the main driver of increases in
                homelessness and Los Angeles is the least affordable housing
                market in the United States (LAHSA, 2019).

            Methodology and data sources
          </h2>
          <p>
            We began with the LA Times neighborhood boundaries. We then selected
            311 calls for "homelessness encampment" complaints for the City of
            Los Angeles in 2018. We also used Airbnb listing locations available
            on the countermapping website, Inside Airbnb, for the month of
            September 2019. The two data sets were analyzed in Python to
            calculate the density of values per acre and three neighborhoods
            were selected based on highest density of homeless encampment
            complaints and Airbnb listings. To understand the complexity of the
            dichotomy, a narrative for each neighborhood is shared, along with
            contrasting visuals and descriptions about Airbnb and homelessness.
