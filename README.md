This data story was created by Regina Joy Alcazar and Ri Le for the course Informatics 1 during 2019 Fall taught by Professor Anthony P. Vanky at the Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation.

This web story was built on Web technology: HTML/CSS/JS, Waypoints, Vega-Lite, and Leaflet, and hosted on Glitch. Data processing was done with Python, namely the geopandas package.
